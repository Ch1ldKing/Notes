Classification(Supervised)标记数据训练，非标数据预测
Naive Bayes Classification assume that conditional independence parameter, making the training easy and fast

as you see ,we assumed that the parameters are independent , so we are able to calculate conditional probabilities like this, you can calculate the conditional probabilities just with Prior separately
