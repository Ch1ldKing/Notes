If we want to reverse-engineer how the brain works, if we want to build Rosey, if we want to uncover the hidden nature of human intelligence, perhaps the human brain is not nature’s best clue. While the most intuitive place to look to understand the human brain is, naturally, inside the human brain itself, counterintuitively, this may be the last place to look. The best place to start may be in dusty fossils deep in the Earth’s crust, in microscopic genes tucked away inside cells throughout the animal kingdom, and in the brains of the many other animals that populate our planet. In other words, the answer might not be in the present, but in the hidden remnants of a long time past.
如果我们想要逆向破解人脑，或想要创造类似Rosey的机器人，也许人脑并不是最好的线索。虽然直觉上研究人脑本身是理解它的最佳途径，但最好的答案或许隐藏在地球深处的化石、动物细胞的微观基因，以及其他动物的大脑中。换句话说，答案可能不在当下，而在过去的遗迹中。
In evolution, systems start simple, and complexity emerges only over time. * The first brain—the first collection of neurons in the head of an animal —appeared six hundred million years ago in a worm the size of a grain of rice. This worm was the ancestor of all modern brain-endowed animals. Over hundreds of millions of years of evolutionary tinkering, through trillions of small tweaks in wiring, her simple brain was transformed into the diverse portfolio of modern brains. One lineage of this ancient worm’s descendants led to the brain in our heads.
进化使系统从简单开始，复杂性则随着时间的推移逐渐显现。
第一个大脑——即动物头部中神经元的集合——出现在6亿年前一条米粒大小的蠕虫体内。这种蠕虫是所有现代拥有大脑的动物的祖先。经过数亿年的进化调整，这种简单的大脑逐渐演变为如今多样化的大脑类型，其中一支进化线路最终造就了我们人类的大脑。
