If we want to reverse-engineer how the brain works, if we want to build Rosey, if we want to uncover the hidden nature of human intelligence, perhaps the human brain is not nature’s best clue. While the most intuitive place to look to understand the human brain is, naturally, inside the human brain itself, counterintuitively, this may be the last place to look. The best place to start may be in dusty fossils deep in the Earth’s crust, in microscopic genes tucked away inside cells throughout the animal kingdom, and in the brains of the many other animals that populate our planet. In other words, the answer might not be in the present, but in the hidden remnants of a long time past.
如果我们想要逆向破解人脑，或想要创造类似Rosey的机器人，也许人脑并不是最好的线索。虽然直觉上研究人脑本身是理解它的最佳途径，但最好的答案或许隐藏在地球深处的化石、动物细胞的微观基因，以及其他动物的大脑中。换句话说，答案可能不在当下，而在过去的遗迹中。
