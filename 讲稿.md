### novelty of the main idea
This book integrates evolutionary ecology, neuroscience, and AI to explore the origins and future of human intelligence through five breakthroughs. It bridges biology and AI, blending philosophical and technological perspectives. The narrative uses metaphors and open-ended questions to engage readers, offering a clear, layered framework for understanding evolution and intelligence.

## Introduction
 Evolution starts with simplicity, and over time, complexity emerges. Through millions of years and countless small changes, early brains evolved into the diverse modern brains, including ours. To understand intelligence, we must study both the brain and AI, as they mutually inform and enhance each other’s development.

## IDEA
In AI commercialization, business teams seek valuable applications, while machine learning teams know what’s feasible. Often, tasks seem simple to businesspeople because they align with human intuition, but machine learning experts explain their complexity. These debates sparked the author’s curiosity about the brain and its relationship with AI.

## The Birth of Intelligence

有氧呼吸出现,能量利用方式促使呼吸生物开始以光合作用生物为猎物，直接掠夺其糖分储备.真核细胞拥有更高的能量利用效率和复杂的内部结构
大型多细胞生命:神经元的出现，然后是电脉冲和化学传递信号
动物与真菌分道扬镳时，动物选择了捕猎多细胞猎物的生存策略，而真菌则依靠外部消化等待有机物死亡。捕猎的需求推动了神经元的进化，使动物能够快速、精准地感知和响应外部刺激。
智慧最初的萌芽，也为接下来的大脑进化拉开了序幕
Life on Earth existed for over three billion years before the first brain appeared. Early life relied on simple processes like self-replication and chemical cascades, with proteins enabling movement and perception, laying the foundation for primitive intelligence. Evolution led to photosynthetic bacteria like cyanobacteria, which began producing oxygen and terraforming Earth. This rise in oxygen spurred the development of respiration-based life forms and competition for resources, eventually leading to the emergence of eukaryotes, multicellular organisms, and the evolution of neurons and brains.

Neurons are fundamental units of life across species, forming the backbone of the nervous system, enabling not only basic reflexes and movement, but also the complex behaviors that distinguish animals from other forms of life. From a biological standpoint, neurons are the primary cells of the nervous system, operating in similar ways across diverse species, whether in humans or jellyfish. Evolution has shaped their connectivity and function, but their fundamental structure has remained the same for over 600 million years.

双侧对称身体结构（bilateral symmetry）：前端有大脑、口和感官器官，后端排泄废物,相比径向对称（radial symmetry）可以更高效地移动和转向
这些生物具有简单的导航能力，在气味增加时继续前进，气味减少时转弯。这种“转向导航”能力来源于大脑对双侧对称身体的控制
Bilateral symmetry, with a brain, sensory organs, and mouth at the front, enables efficient movement and navigation. This symmetry allows organisms to continue moving when scent increases and turn when it decreases, a behavior controlled by the brain.

Emotions and behavior in bilaterally symmetrical animals are regulated through valence (positive/negative) and arousal. Positive valence, like food, encourages exploration, while negative valence, like predators, triggers escape. Arousal influences the intensity of actions—high arousal leads to fast movement, while low arousal causes stagnation. These mechanisms help animals adapt even after external stimuli fade.

The stress response is a survival mechanism involving acute stress and recovery. Negative stimuli trigger the "fight or flight" response, but prolonged stress can lead to chronic stress, reducing reactivity to both negative and positive stimuli. This adaptation can cause learned helplessness, where animals stop attempting to escape or improve their situation.

Learning involves the formation of connections between stimuli and responses, based on the Hebbian rule: "neurons that fire together, wire together." This neural plasticity, driven by neuromodulators, allows animals to adapt their behaviors, optimizing responses to the environment.
### 情感
情绪和情感的基础可以追溯到最早的双侧对称动物，它们的大脑通过效价（valence）和唤醒度（arousal）来调节行为状态。这种机制在包括线虫在内的简单生物中展现出明确的行为模式：**正效价**（如食物）促使它们停留并探索环境，而**负效价**（如捕食者）促使它们快速逃离。唤醒度则决定了行为的强度，高唤醒度表现为快速游动，低唤醒度则表现为停滞或缓慢行动。这种持久的情绪状态允许动物在外部刺激消失后，仍能继续采取相应行为，提高适应性

压力反应是进化赋予生物的生存机制，其核心是**急性压力反应**和**恢复反应**的协作。在遭遇负效价刺激（如威胁或危险）时，神经调节剂（如肾上腺素和去甲肾上腺素）触发了广为人知的“战或逃”反应。
压力长期得不到缓解时，急性压力反应可能转化为慢性压力慢性压力的核心在于适应性机制：长时间的负面刺激会将动物的神经系统调整到一种低反应性状态，减少对负面和正面刺激的反应。这种现象在许多双侧对称动物中都有体现，如蟑螂、蛞蝓和果蝇。这些生物在持续的负面环境中会表现出“习得性无助”的行为，即停止尝试逃脱或寻求改善

### 学习
建立刺激与反应之间的联系。这种机制称为赫布学习规则（"同时触发的神经元会彼此联接"），突触强度的改变使神经网络能够适应环境。学习是从早期双侧对称动物演化而来的古老机制，优化导航行为，其基础在于突触的可塑性和神经调节物质的作用。

### 强化学习
**强化学习**（Reinforcement Learning）：通过正强化（奖励）和负强化（惩罚）调整行为概率
- 脊椎动物的大脑成为一种通用的强化学习机器，能灵活适应环境变化。
- 试错学习为未来更高级的认知功能奠定了基础，包括计划、预测和复杂问题解决。
时序差分学习：系统中的预测者不断更新对未来奖励的预测，行动者根据预测结果调整行为。两者通过相互修正，逐渐提高学习能力
多巴胺在脊椎动物大脑中充当强化信号，与TD学习的预测差分信号高度一致：

- 奖励预测时多巴胺水平上升。
- 预期奖励缺失时多巴胺水平下降。
- 多巴胺并非“愉悦信号”，而是关于“强化”的信号，驱动生物重复能提高奖励的行为。

Reinforcement Learning is a process where behavior is shaped by rewards (positive reinforcement) and punishments (negative reinforcement), guiding an organism toward behaviors that maximize benefits and minimize costs. In vertebrates, the brain functions as a universal reinforcement learning machine. It adapts flexibly to environmental changes, using trial-and-error learning to improve behavior. This foundational process supports more complex cognitive functions, including planning, prediction, and problem-solving. A key mechanism in reinforcement learning is Temporal Difference (TD) Learning, where a predictor continually adjusts its forecast of future rewards, and an actor modifies its behavior based on these predictions. The two work together, refining each other’s predictions and behaviors over time, improving overall learning efficiency. Dopamine plays a crucial role in this system. It acts as a reinforcement signal, aligning with the TD learning's prediction error signal: When a reward is predicted, dopamine levels rise. When the expected reward is absent, dopamine levels fall. Dopamine is not simply a "pleasure signal"; it is a "reinforcement signal" that encourages behaviors that increase rewards. The basal ganglia help suppress ineffective actions, allowing more beneficial behaviors to emerge. Together with the hippocampus, they enable animals to not only remember what to do, but also when and where to do it. This forms an internal model of the world, with the spatial map being one of its earliest forms—used initially for remembering locations and paths. Shorter to 100 words, but is still a speech

新皮层（neocortex）**的出现**
The primary new brain structure that emerged in early mammals was the neocortex. With the neocortex came the gift of simulation—the third breakthrough in our evolutionary story. To summarize how this occurred and how it was used: Sensory neocortex evolved, which created a simulation of the external world (a world model).
The agranular prefrontal cortex (aPFC) evolved, which was the first region of the frontal neocortex. The aPFC created a simulation of an animal’s own movements and internal states (a self model) and constructed “intent” to explain one’s own behavior.

The emergence of the neocortex marked a critical development in early mammals. This new brain structure enabled a remarkable breakthrough—simulation. The neocortex, especially the sensory areas, created a mental representation of the external world, a model that allowed for complex interaction with the environment. The agranular prefrontal cortex (aPFC), the first part of the frontal neocortex to evolve, expanded this ability. It allowed mammals to simulate their own movements and internal states, forming a self-model that provided a framework for understanding and explaining their own behaviors and intentions. What advantage did this simulation capability bring? Virtual trial and error: Early mammals could simulate potential actions and their outcomes in their minds, enabling them to choose the best course of action before physical execution. Counterfactual learning: The ability to analyze causal relationships allowed for more precise behavior adjustment. This went beyond simple reinforcement learning, providing a deeper understanding of how actions lead to consequences. Contextual memory: Mammals could recall past events and behaviors, using those memories to guide future actions and avoid past mistakes. Motor cortex evolution: The ability to simulate and plan specific physical movements enabled more precise and flexible control over actions, facilitating better coordination. In essence, the neocortex enabled thinking as we know it today—the ability to imagine, simulate, and predict future scenarios, to learn from past mistakes, and to adapt more effectively to an ever-changing environment. Unlike fish and reptiles, whose behaviors remain largely reflexive and non-planned, early mammals could engage in more sophisticated, anticipatory actions, fundamentally transforming their capacity to interact with the world. 

The neocortex, emerging in early mammals, enabled a key breakthrough: simulation. It allowed mammals to create mental models of the world, simulating actions and outcomes before execution. This provided virtual trial and error, counterfactual learning, and contextual memory. The agranular prefrontal cortex expanded this by enabling self-modeling, improving behavior and intention understanding. The evolution of the motor cortex allowed for more precise movement control. Ultimately, the neocortex gave mammals the ability to think, predict, and adapt, transforming their capacity to interact with the world in a more sophisticated and anticipatory way than fish or reptiles.

As the African savannah forests began to disappear, early humans were forced to adapt to a new ecological niche centered around tool-making and meat-eating. This shift demanded the ability to accurately pass on tool-making skills across generations. To meet this need, **primitive language** gradually emerged, enabling the successful transmission of these critical skills.

- **Primitive dialogue** and **joint attention** were key mechanisms in this process, helping children connect names with elements in their mental models. Through this learning, older areas of the neocortex were repurposed to support language functions.
- Communication with non-kin individuals through language initiated feedback loops that fostered more complex language skills. These loops were shaped by cycles of **gossip**, **altruism**, and **punishment**, driving the selective evolution of language.

This ability to communicate across brains led to the emergence of **group thinking**, where knowledge could be stored and shared, and humans could pool their accumulated wisdom. This also correlated with the evolution of larger brains and the development of cooking techniques, which further contributed to our cognitive growth.

The advent of language not only transformed human communication but also introduced a vast range of behaviors, from altruism to cruelty. Language became a powerful tool for both cooperation and conflict, influencing the dynamics of human societies and the way we interact with each other and the world.

## AI
尽管这些模型在文本预测和语言生成方面有巨大进步，但它们缺乏人类语言理解背后的**内在模拟能力（simulating）**和**对他人心智的建模能力（mentalizing）**。这些能力是人类智力的核心，使得我们能够以语言为窗口，推演世界规则，理解他人意图，建立深层次的因果关系模型。

随着GPT-4的发布，通过额外的训练和强化学习，它在回答常识和逻辑问题方面表现出更好的能力，但仍未实现真正的人类式思维。这段强调了，尽管大语言模型的发展极为迅速，其核心机制仍与人类智力存在根本差异。真正类人AI的未来，需要突破语言模型的局限，整合对现实世界和他人心智的模拟能力。

Despite the significant progress made by models like GPT in text prediction and language generation, they still lack the **internal simulation abilities** and **mentalizing** skills that underpin human language understanding. These abilities are at the core of human intelligence, enabling us to use language as a window into the world, reason through rules, understand others' intentions, and build deep causal models.

With the release of GPT-4, improvements through additional training and reinforcement learning have made it more adept at answering common-sense and logical questions. However, it still falls short of achieving true human-like thinking. This highlights that, while the development of large language models has been rapid, their core mechanisms are still fundamentally different from human intelligence. For AI to truly resemble human cognition, it will need to go beyond the limitations of language models and integrate the ability to simulate the real world and the minds of others.
